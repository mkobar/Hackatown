###What it does

eyeBeacon is a phone application where the user is able to walk around freely and get notified (by speech or by different hand gestures) whenever they get near or towards a Beacon (Estimotes).
###How we built it

Our android application was built with Android Studio. We were able to connect the Estimote Beacons through integrating their SDK and dependencies into our system. We integrated text to speech to output voice commands.
###Challenges we ran into

Getting the accurate distances of Estimote Beacons to our phones, integrating text to speech into our project, and setting up the environment for Estimotes.
###Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to learn new technologies and to successfully create a fully functional application.
What we learned

Android studio and Estimote.
###What's next for eyeBeacon

To get a better response time from the Estimote Beacons and to allow the Beacons to alternate between the colors of the traffic light.
